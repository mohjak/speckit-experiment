# Personal Blog Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modern Aesthetics
Website must have a sleek, contemporary design that stands out; Clean typography, ample whitespace, and thoughtful color scheme required; Visual hierarchy should guide users naturally through content

### II. Content Organization
Site structure includes: Landing page with featured blog post, Blogs page listing all posts, About page, and FAQ page; All 20 blog posts will use mocked data rather than pulling from external feeds

### III. User Experience
Navigation must be intuitive and seamless; Loading times should be minimal; Responsive design mandatory for all device sizes; Accessibility standards must be met

### IV. Data Management
All blog content (20 posts) will be statically mocked within the application; No external API calls or database connections required; Content structure must support titles, dates, tags, and body text

### V. Performance Standards
Optimized for fast loading (under 2 seconds); Minimal bundle size through efficient code splitting; Images properly compressed and lazy-loaded where appropriate

## Technical Implementation

Static site built with modern frontend technologies (React/Vue/Angular or vanilla JS); Component-based architecture for reusability; CSS preprocessors or CSS-in-JS for maintainable styling; No backend or server-side processing required

## Development Workflow

Component-driven development approach; Regular commits with descriptive messages; Peer code reviews before merging; Automated testing for critical functionality; Continuous integration pipeline for deployment

## Governance

Constitution guides all development decisions for the personal blog; Any amendments require documentation and approval; Pull requests must verify compliance with design and performance standards; Features must enhance user experience without unnecessary complexity
